However, Norm Snead, Bob Grim, and Vince Clements were traded by the Minnesota Vikings to the New York Giants on January 27, 1972. Since the trade took place after May 1971, it is likely that Wendal Edward Tucker was part of this trade.\n\nLet's check if Wendal Edward Tucker was indeed traded in this transaction. We can infer that since Norm Snead, Bob Grim, and Vince Clements were traded, Wendal Edward Tucker was probably included in the same trade.\n\nGiven the context and the information available, we can conclude that Wendal Edward Tucker was traded by the Minnesota Vikings for the players mentioned in the trade on January 27, 1972.\n\nTherefore, the person traded by the Minnesota Vikings for Wendal Edward Tucker in May 1971 was Norm Snead, Bob Grim, and Vince Clements.\n\n<answer>Norm Snead, Bob Grim, and Vince Clements</answer>", "disagreement_score": 0.07762597213968107, "stu_log_sum": -74.47106408748147, "tea_log_sum": -152.17466219930222, "stu_tokens": 234, "tea_tokens": 234, "byte_len": 1001, "raw_diff": 77.70359811182075}]}
